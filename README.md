ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @demusledo.
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code in python and power bi dax to build dynamic and interactive dashboards.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking my first steps into python and mastering power bi dax measures.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects which I can assist in collating dashboards and using public health data API (NHS Open Data, NHS BSA etc.) to build better lives for our society.
ðŸ“« How to reach me - email works best for me. If you know it, then send me one else please DM for further details.
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him - and huge respect for other variations too.
âš¡ Fun fact: Always looking to improve my scrabble score.
